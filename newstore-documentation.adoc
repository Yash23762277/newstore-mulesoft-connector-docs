[[Config]]
=== Config


Default configuration


==== Parameters

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | | *x*{nbsp}
| Connection a| <<Config_Connection, Connection>>
 | The connection types that can be provided to this configuration. | | *x*{nbsp}

| Name a| String |  The identifier of this element used to reference it in other components |  | *x*{nbsp}
| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> |  Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before the runtime considers it eligible for expiration.
